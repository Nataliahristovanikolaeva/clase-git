<p><em>GIT</em>, our who art in the repos<br />
Compressed be thy <em>commits</em><br />
May thy <em>log</em> come to us<br />
In the local as in the <em>remote</em><br />
Give us today our daily <em>pull</em><br />
Forgive our <em>conflicts</em><br />
As we also forgive those of other geeks<br />
Lead us not into <em>detached HEAD</em><br />
and deliver us from <em>SVN</em><br />
<code>git commit --amend</code></p>
